# Canvas Glitch

## A Brief description

Glitch Effect on wikipedia.org [ [ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Глитч-арт) | [en](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art) ]
As in most implementations, based on _[HTMLCanvasElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement)_ and
_[Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)_. But in a specific implementation, the javascript
library _[p5.js](https://p5js.org)_ takes care of all the work with canvas. The script itself loads the image and implements the
logic of pixel distortion and color shift.

## Install

To run this script, you must have a local server, a virtual server, or a public server on the network. Opening the index file
in a browser will not work in this case. And depending on the platform/tool you are using, service settings are set. In the
general case of configuration, the root directory of the project, the host and the listening port are indicated.

In this situation, you can clone/download this repository, open it in VS Code, and start Live Server. Another option
is to install the npm package _[serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve)_ and follow its instructions to run the script. Or just to get acquainted with the demo,
